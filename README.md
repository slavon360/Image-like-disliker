# Description
The button "next" on the right side of panel allows you to change the picture,
on conditions that it already liked or disliked. You can also go to previous picture,
 but only if current picture is already checked (liked/disliked). When all pictures
  are checked - new elements are created and arranged at the bottom of the page. Each 
  element represent the picture that was liked or disliked. Also we can see 
  the statistic of "total pushes", "likes", "dislikes" and like-dislike bar.
